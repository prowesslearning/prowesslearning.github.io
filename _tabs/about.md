**Hello, Tech Enthusiast! It's Great to Meet You.**
Welcome to my corner of the internet, where bytes meet insights and complex concepts get a clear explanation. If you're here, chances are you're just as fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology as I am â€“ especially when it comes to the backbone of modern IT: infrastructure and the boundless possibilities of the cloud.

My name is Amit Kumar, and I'm genuinely thrilled to have you here. 

This blog is born out of a simple, yet profound, passion: **to share the learnings accumulated over a quarter-century in the trenches of IT.**
